## Step-by-Step Implementation Approach

To address the MCP server startup issue in Claude Code, we need to investigate the `cwd` parameter and ensure that the server can start correctly. Here's a step-by-step approach to diagnose and fix the problem:

1. **Verify the Working Directory:**
   - First, confirm that the `cwd` parameter is being correctly set and used by Claude Code. Print the current working directory inside `mcp_stdio_server.py` to check if it matches the expected path.

2. **Check File Permissions:**
   - Ensure that the user running Claude Code has the necessary permissions to access the specified working directory and all required files.

3. **Test with Absolute Paths:**
   - Modify the configuration to use absolute paths for both the command and the working directory. This can help eliminate any potential issues with relative paths.

4. **Logging and Error Handling:**
   - Implement more detailed logging in `mcp_stdio_server.py` to capture any errors or warnings during startup.

5. **Simulate Claude Code Environment:**
   - Create a script that mimics the Claude Code environment to test the server startup independently.

6. **Debugging in Claude Code:**
   - If the issue persists, use Claude Code's debugging tools to trace the execution and identify where the startup fails.

## Code Examples

### 1. Verify Working Directory in `mcp_stdio_server.py`

Add the following at the beginning of `mcp_stdio_server.py`:

```python
import os

# Print current working directory
print(f"Current working directory: {os.getcwd()}")
```

### 2. Modify Configuration for Absolute Paths

Update the configuration in Claude Code to use absolute paths:

```json
{
  "command": "uv",
  "args": ["run", "python", "/home/per/gitrepos/discussWithGrokMCP/mcp_stdio_server.py"],
  "cwd": "/home/per/gitrepos/discussWithGrokMCP"
}
```

### 3. Implement Detailed Logging

Add more detailed logging to `mcp_stdio_server.py`:

```python
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler('grok_mcp_server.log'),
        logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)
    ]
)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Log server startup
logger.debug("Starting Grok MCP Server")
try:
    # Your server startup code here
    logger.info("Grok MCP Server started successfully")
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed to start Grok MCP Server: {str(e)}")
    raise
```

### 4. Simulate Claude Code Environment

Create a script to simulate the Claude Code environment:

```python
import subprocess
import os

# Set the working directory
cwd = "/home/per/gitrepos/discussWithGrokMCP"

# Run the command
command = ["uv", "run", "python", "mcp_stdio_server.py"]
process = subprocess.Popen(command, cwd=cwd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)

# Capture output
stdout, stderr = process.communicate()

# Print results
print("Standard Output:")
print(stdout.decode())
print("\nStandard Error:")
print(stderr.decode())

# Check if the process was successful
if process.returncode == 0:
    print("Grok MCP Server started successfully")
else:
    print(f"Grok MCP Server failed to start. Return code: {process.returncode}")
```

## Best Practices to Follow

1. **Use Absolute Paths:** When dealing with file paths in configurations, use absolute paths to avoid ambiguity and potential issues with relative paths.

2. **Implement Comprehensive Logging:** Use logging to capture detailed information about the server's startup process. This can help diagnose issues that occur in different environments.

3. **Test in Isolation:** Before integrating into a larger system like Claude Code, test the server in isolation to ensure it can start correctly.

4. **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling and logging to capture any exceptions or issues during startup.

5. **Environment Consistency:** Ensure that the environment where the server is tested (e.g., local machine) closely matches the production environment (Claude Code).

## Potential Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Assuming Consistent Working Directories:** Don't assume that the working directory set in the configuration will be the same as when the script is run directly.

2. **Ignoring Permissions:** Overlooking file or directory permissions can lead to unexpected failures, especially when running as different users.

3. **Neglecting Environment Variables:** Ensure that all necessary environment variables are set correctly in the Claude Code environment.

4. **Lack of Detailed Logging:** Without detailed logging, it can be challenging to diagnose issues that only occur in specific environments.

5. **Overlooking Configuration Differences:** Be aware that the configuration used in Claude Code might differ from what you test locally.

## Next Steps

1. **Implement the suggested modifications to `mcp_stdio_server.py` and test locally.**

2. **Run the simulation script to verify that the server starts correctly in a controlled environment.**

3. **Update the configuration in Claude Code to use absolute paths and test again.**

4. **If issues persist, use Claude Code's debugging tools to trace the execution and identify where the startup fails.**

5. **Review logs and error messages to pinpoint the exact cause of the failure in Claude Code.**

By following these steps and considering the potential pitfalls, you should be able to resolve the MCP server startup issue in Claude Code.
