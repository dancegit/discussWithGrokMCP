Based on the provided context and your query, I'll address the issue of the Grok MCP server being marked as 'failed' by Claude Code CLI despite working correctly in manual tests. Let's break down the response into the requested sections:

1. **Direct Answer:**

   Several factors could cause Claude Code to mark a working MCP server as failed, even if it's functioning correctly in manual tests:

   a. **Timing Issues**: Claude Code might have strict timing requirements for responses that your server isn't meeting. It could be closing connections or timing out before your server responds.

   b. **Protocol Mismatches**: Even if you're avoiding stdout and using absolute paths, there might be subtle protocol differences between what your server implements and what Claude Code expects.

   c. **Error Handling**: Your server might be handling errors differently than Claude Code anticipates, leading to unexpected behavior.

   d. **Unexpected Responses**: Your server might be sending responses that are technically correct but not exactly what Claude Code is looking for.

   e. **Version Compatibility**: There could be version incompatibilities between your server and the Claude Code CLI that aren't immediately apparent.

   f. **Logging and Debugging**: Claude Code might be using different logging levels or debug information that your server isn't providing.

2. **Context-Aware Guidance:**

   Given the files and areas mentioned:

   a. **Review test_integration.py**: Ensure that your integration tests cover all the scenarios that Claude Code might be checking. Add specific tests for the initialize request, initialized notification, and tools/list response.

   b. **Check Protocol Implementation**: In your MCP server code (not shown in the provided files), double-check that you're implementing the protocol exactly as Claude Code expects. Pay special attention to any optional fields or extensions.

   c. **Add Detailed Logging**: Increase the logging level in your server to capture more detailed information about the communication with Claude Code. This could help identify where the mismatch is occurring.

   d. **Simulate Claude Code Environment**: Try to replicate the exact environment that Claude Code is using when it tests your server. This might involve using the same versions of dependencies and running in a similar setup.

3. **Best Practices:**

   a. **Comprehensive Testing**: Implement thorough unit and integration tests that cover all aspects of the MCP protocol.

   b. **Strict Protocol Adherence**: Follow the MCP protocol specifications exactly, including any optional fields or recommended behaviors.

   c. **Robust Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling that gracefully handles unexpected inputs or situations.

   d. **Version Control and Documentation**: Keep track of the versions of your server, dependencies, and testing tools. Document any deviations from standard implementations.

   e. **Continuous Integration**: Set up CI/CD pipelines that include tests with Claude Code to catch issues early.

4. **Potential Issues:**

   a. **Asynchronous Timing**: If your server uses async operations, ensure they're completing within the expected timeframes.

   b. **JSON Encoding/Decoding**: Double-check that your JSON serialization/deserialization matches what Claude Code expects.

   c. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all necessary environment variables are set correctly in the Claude Code test environment.

   d. **File Permissions**: Verify that all necessary files have the correct permissions when running under Claude Code.

   e. **Network Issues**: Consider potential network-related issues if Claude Code is running in a different environment.

5. **Next Steps:**

   a. **Implement Detailed Logging**: Add extensive logging to your server to capture the exact communication with Claude Code.

   b. **Create Specific Tests**: Add tests in `test_integration.py` that replicate the exact scenarios Claude Code is checking.

   c. **Review Protocol Documentation**: Carefully review the MCP protocol documentation to ensure full compliance.

   d. **Version Check**: Verify that your server and all dependencies are compatible with the version of Claude Code you're using.

   e. **Simulate Claude Code Environment**: Set up a test environment that closely mimics what Claude Code uses.

   f. **Reach Out to Claude Code Developers**: If issues persist, consider reaching out to the Claude Code team for more detailed information on what might be causing the 'failed' status.

Here's a code example to add more detailed logging to your MCP server:

```python
import logging

# Set up detailed logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class MCPServer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.logger = logger

    async def handle_request(self, request):
        self.logger.debug(f"Received request: {request}")
        
        try:
            # Process the request
            response = await self.process_request(request)
            self.logger.debug(f"Sending response: {response}")
            return response
        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.error(f"Error processing request: {e}", exc_info=True)
            raise

    async def process_request(self, request):
        # Implement your request processing logic here
        pass

    def log_connection(self, client_address):
        self.logger.info(f"New connection from {client_address}")

    def log_disconnection(self, client_address):
        self.logger.info(f"Disconnection from {client_address}")
```

This logging setup will help you capture more detailed information about the server's interactions with Claude Code, which can be crucial for identifying where the mismatch is occurring.

Remember to adjust the logging level and format as needed for your specific debugging needs. Also, ensure that this detailed logging is only enabled in your development and testing environments, not in production, to avoid performance impacts.
